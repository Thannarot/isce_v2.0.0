# This class allows the creation of a BILImage object. The parameters that need to be set are
#\verbatim
#WIDTH: width of the image in units of the DATA_TYPE. Mandatory. 
#FILE_NAME: name of the file containing the image. Mandatory.
#DATA_TYPE: data  type used to store the image. The naming convention is the one adopted by numpy (see LineAccessor class). Optional. Default value 'BYTE'. 
#ACCESS_MODE: access mode of the file such as 'read', 'write' etc. See LineAccessor class for all possible values. Mandatory.
#SCHEME: the interleaving scheme adopted for the image. Could be BIL (band interleaved by line), BIP (band intereleaved by pixel) and BSQ (band sequential). Optional. BIP set by default.
#CASTER: define the type of caster. For example DoubleToFloat reads the image data as double but puts it into a buffer that is of float type. Optional. If not provided casting is not performed.
#\endverbatim
#Since the BILImage class inherits the Image.Image, the methods of initialization described in the Component package can be used.
#Moreover each parameter can be set with the corresponding accessor method setParameter() (see the class member methods).
#@see DataAccessor.Image.
#@see Component.Component.
