<!-- Shown above is the bare minimum input XML file for ROI_PAC sensor. The master and slave catalog xml files have the same structure.

All file paths in the input files should either be absolute paths or relative to the processing directory.


    Note 1: Inputs
    ===============

    ROI_PAC sensor is used to read in raw data that was generated using JPL's ROI_PAC software. Note that there is no "OUTPUT" tag for this sensor. The raw file is directly ingested by ISCE. It is also assumed that the rsc file associated with the RAWFILE is available in the same directory. The following three files are read in by ISCE:

    rawfile       (RAWFILE tag)        -> raw file generated by ROI_PAC
    rawfile.rsc                        -> rsc file for the raw data generated by ROI_PAC
    hdr_data_points.rsc (HDRFILE tag)  -> orbit file generated by ROI_PAC. 


    Note 2: More frequent orbit samples
    ===================================

    For geometric accuracy, ISCE performs best when the available state vectors are 10-30 seconds apart. Users may have to modify their ROI_PAC make_raw scripts to generate appropriate hdr orbit files with good temporal sampling. This is particularly needed when dealing with raw data generated by stitching multiple frames.
